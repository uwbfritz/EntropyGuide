# Getting Started: Tips

Entropy 2099 is an awesome game, however, there are not many online resources to help you further your game. Reddit isn't much help, and there are not many fan sites available to pull from when learning how to build formations, particular game mechanics, or other items. &#x20;

Here are some tips that I wish I knew when getting started:

* **Join an alliance as soon as you can.**  I can't stress this enough. There are many, many benefits to doing so, including help with your formations, perks and buffs, and others to play with.
* **Keep leveling/building your base:** Better base = more power. Many upgrades will offer you better benefits and more power.&#x20;
* **Do main missions, and your daily intel missions:** Not only will both of these help you level, you will also gain rewards and help out your alliance by doing so.&#x20;
